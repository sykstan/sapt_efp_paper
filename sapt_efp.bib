  abstract = {The development of a fragment–fragment dispersion energy expression, for the general effective fragment potential (EFP2) method is presented. C6 dispersion coefficients, expressed in terms of the dynamic polarizabilties over the imaginary frequency range (α(iν)), were calculated for a set of homo and hetero dimers. Using these coefficients the dispersion energy has been calculated. The dispersion energy is expressed using a simple London series expansion terminated after the n=6 term and implemented using distributed localized molecular orbitals (LMOs). The EFP2 dispersion energy is compared to symmetry adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) values. From this comparison, it is apparent that one needs to include higher order terms in the dispersion energy. Adding an estimated C8 term to the C6 energy greatly improves the agreement with the benchmark SAPT energies.},

  abstract = {This study is the first step in the systematic investigation of substituted (carboxyl) polystyrene nanoparticles. Understanding the fundamental interactions between the p-carboxyl styrene monomers, where an ethyl group is used instead of a vinyl group (referenced, for convenience, as ?p-carboxyl styrene?), provides the basic information needed to construct potentials for nanoparticles composed of these monomers. In this work, low-energy isomers of p-carboxyl styrene dimer were studied. The dimer structures and their relative and binding energies were determined using both M?ller?Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2) and the general effective fragment potential (EFP2) method. Sections of the intermolecular potential energy surface (PES) of the p-carboxylated styrene dimer in its global minimum orientation were also determined. As expected, double hydrogen bonding between the two carboxylic groups provides the strongest interaction in this system, followed by isomers with a single H-bond and strong benzene ring?benzene ring (π?π) type interactions. Generally, the EFP2 method reproduces the MP2 geometries and relative energies with good accuracy, so it appears to be an efficient alternative to the correlated ab initio methods, which are too computationally demanding to be routinely used in the study of the more-complex polymeric systems of interest.},

  abstract = {Testing of the spin-component scaled second-order M?ller?Plesset (SCS-MP2) method for the computation of noncovalent interaction energies is done with a database of 165 biologically relevant complexes. The effects of the spin-scaling procedure (i.e., MP2 vs SCS-MP2), the basis set size, and the corrections for basis set superposition error (BSSE) are systematically examined. When using two-point basis set extrapolations for the correlation energy, augmentation of the atomic orbital basis with computationally costly diffuse functions is found to be obsolete. In general, SCS-MP2 also improves results for noncovalent interactions statistically on MP2, and significant outliers are removed. Moreover, it is shown that effects of BSSE and one-particle basis set incompleteness almost cancel each other in the case of triple-? sets (SCS-MP2/TZVPP or SCS-MP2/cc-pVTZ without counterpoise correction), which opens a practical route to efficient computations for large systems. We recommend SCS-MP2 as the preferred quantum chemical wave function based method for the noncovalent interactions in large biologically relevant systems when reasonable coupled-cluster with single and double and perturbative triple excitations (CCSD(T)) calculations cannot be performed anymore. A comparison to MP2 and CCSD(T) interaction energies for n-alkane dimers, however, indicates (and this also holds to a lesser extent for hydrogen-bonded systems) limitations of SCS-MP2 when treating chemically ?saturated? interactions. The different behavior of second-order perturbation theory for saturated and for stacked π-systems is discussed.},

  abstract = {Fluorobenzenes are π-acceptor synthons that form π-stacked structures in molecular crystals as well as in artificial DNAs. We investigate the competition between hydrogen bonding and π-stacking in dimers consisting of the nucleobase mimic 2-pyridone (2PY) and all fluorobenzenes from 1-fluorobenzene to hexafluorobenzene (n-FB, with n = 1–6). We contrast the results of high level ab initio calculations with those obtained using ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) laser spectroscopy of isolated and supersonically cooled dimers. The 2PY·n-FB complexes with n = 1–5 prefer double hydrogen bonding over π-stacking, as diagnosed from the UV absorption and IR laser depletion spectra, which both show features characteristic of doubly H-bonded complexes. The 2-pyridone·hexafluorobenzene dimer is the only π-stacked dimer, exhibiting a homogeneously broadened UV spectrum and no IR bands characteristic for H-bonded species. MP2 (second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory) calculations overestimate the π-stacked dimer binding energies by about 10 kJ/mol and disagree with the experimental observations. In contrast, the MP2 treatment of the H-bonded dimers appears to be quite accurate. Grimme’s spin-component-scaled MP2 approach (SCS-MP2) is an improvement over MP2 for the π-stacked dimers, reducing the binding energy by 10 kJ/mol. When applied to explicitly correlated MP2 theory (SCS-MP2-R12 approach), agreement with the corresponding coupled-cluster binding energies [at the CCSD(T) level] is very good for the π-stacked dimers, within ±1 kJ/mol for the 2PY complexes with 1-fluorobenzene, 1,2-difluorobenzene, 1,2,4,5-tetrafluorobenzene, pentafluorobenzene and hexafluorobenzene. Unfortunately, the SCS-MP2 approach also reduces the binding energy of the H-bonded species, leading to disagreement with both coupled-cluster theory and experiment. The SCS-MP2-R12 binding energies follow the SCS-MP2 binding energies closely, being about 0.5 and 0.7 kJ/mol larger for the H-bonded and π-stacked forms, respectively, in an augmented correlation-consistent polarized valence quadruple-zeta basis. It seems that the SCS-MP2 and SCS-MP2-R12 methods cannot provide sufficient accuracy to replace the CCSD(T) method for intermolecular interactions where H-bonding and π-stacking are competitive.},

  abstract =   {I feel very honored that I have been asked to write a Foreword to this book. The subject of the book – “Coupled cluster theory” – has been around for about half a century. The basic theory and explicit equations for closed-shell ground states were formulated before 1970. At the beginning of the seventies the rst ab initio calcu- tion were carried out. At that time speed and memory of computers were very limited compared to today’s standards. Moreover, the size of one-electron bases employed was small, so that it was only possible to achieve an orientation in methodical aspects rather than to generate new signi cant results. Extensive use of the coupled-cluster method started at the beginning of the eighties. With the help of more powerful computers the results of coupled-cluster approaches started to yield more and more interesting results of relevance to the interpretation of experimental data. New ideas in methodology kept appearing and computer codes became more and more ef cient. This exciting situation continues to this very day. Remarkably enough, even the - quired equations can now be generated by a computer with the help of symbolic languages. The size of this monograph and the rich variety of articles it contains attests to the usefulness and viability of the couple-cluster formalism for the h- dling of many-electron correlation effects. This represents a vivid testimony of a tremendous work that has been accomplished in coupled-cluster methodology and its exploitation.},

  abstract =   {Classical molecular dynamics simulations are a valuable tool to study the mechanisms that dominate the properties of ionic liquids (ILs) on the atomistic and molecular level. However, the basis for any molecular dynamics simulation is an accurate force field describing the effective interactions between all atoms in the IL. Normally this is done by empirical potentials which can be partially derived from quantum mechanical calculations on simple subunits or have been fitted to experimental data. Unfortunately, the number of accurate classical non-polarizable models for ILs that allow a reasonable description of both dynamical and statical properties is still low. However, the strongly increasing computational power allows one to apply computationally more expensive methods, and even polarizable-force-field-based models on time and length scales long enough to ensure a proper sampling of the phase space. This review attempts to summarize recent achievements and methods in the development of classical force fields for ionic liquids. As this class of salts covers a large number of compounds, we focus our review on imidazolium-based ionic liquids, but show that the main conclusions are valid for non-imidazolium salts, too. Insight obtained from recent electronic density functional results into the parametrization of partial charges and on the influence of polarization effects in bulk ILs is highlighted. An overview is given of different available force fields, ranging from the atomistic to the coarse-grained level, covering implicit as well as explicit modeling of polarization. We show that the recently popular usage of the ion charge as fit parameter can looked upon as treating polarization effects in a mean-field matter.},

  abstract = {Ionic liquids have been intensively studied during the last decade, but many questions still remain unresolved. From the computational side there is the lack of good transferable force fields for molecular simulations that would allow accurate theoretical predictions and interpretations of the properties of ionic liquids. Within this article a method is described that allows for the derivation of partial charges for ionic liquids since they play a particular important role, particularly for a liquid that consists entirely of ions. Our partial charges are carefully determined in such a way that they incorporate in an average way the influence of polarization effects of the neighboring ions in a bulk situation thereby reducing the total ionic charge to values less than one. When combined with our recently introduced method for the optimization of the short-range interactions [1] we have a well described route to develop generic force fields for ionic liquids. In this article we describe our results for the partial charges for the three imidazolium based liquids [MMIM]+, [EMIM]+, and [BMIM]+ for three different anions.},

The stabilization energies were calculated at HF, B3LYP, MP2, MP4 and CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ levels of theory using optimized geometries of all the complexes obtained from B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ. Quantitatively, all the complexes indicate the presence of B–Ccarbene interaction due to the short B–Ccarbene distances. Inspection of stabilization energies reveals that the interaction energies increase in the order NH2 {\textbackslash}textgreater OH {\textbackslash}textgreater CH3 {\textbackslash}textgreater F {\textbackslash}textgreater H {\textbackslash}textgreater Cl {\textbackslash}textgreater Br {\textbackslash}textgreater NC {\textbackslash}textgreater CN, which is the opposite trend shown in the binding distances. Considering the SAPT results, it is found that electrostatic effects account for about 50\% of the overall attraction of the studied complexes. By comparison, the induction components of these interactions represent about 40\% of the total attractive forces. Despite falling in a region of charge depletion with ∇2 ρ BCP {\textbackslash}textgreater0, the B–Ccarbene bond critical points (BCPs) are characterized by a reasonably large value of the electron density (ρ BCP) and HBCP {\textbackslash}textless0, indicating that the potential energy overcomes the kinetic energy density at BCP and the B–Ccarbene bond is a polar covalent bond.},

As further tests the geometries of weakly bonded systems, transition metal compounds and organic transition states are considered. For almost all systems the SCS-MP2 method outperforms the MP2 approach albeit for the same computational cost.

We report ionic concentrations in the surface of such solutions. Using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy operating at near ambient pressure, we have measured the composition of the liquid/vapor interface for deliquesced samples of potassium bromide and potassium iodide. In both cases, the surface composition of the saturated solution is enhanced in the halide anion compared with the bulk of the solution. The enhancement of anion concentration is more dramatic for the larger, more polarizable iodide anion. By varying photoelectron kinetic energies, we have obtained depth profiles of the liquid/vapor interface. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with classical molecular dynamics simulations. Quantitative comparison between the experiments and the simulations indicates that the experimental results exhibit more interface enhancement than predicted theoretically.},

  abstract =   {Natural energy decomposition analysis (NEDA) is a method for partitioning molecular interaction energies into physically meaningful components, including electrical interaction, charge transfer, and core repulsions. The method is a numerically stable procedure that was originally developed for analyzing Hartree?Fock (HF) wave functions based on the localized orbital description of natural bond orbital analysis. In this work, we extend NEDA to treat charge densities from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, replacing the intermolecular exchange (EX) component of the HF analysis with an exchange-correlation (XC) component. DFT/NEDA is applied to hydrogen bonding interactions and cooperative effects in water clusters. Electrical interactions and charge transfer contribute importantly to hydrogen bonding. Comparison of HF and DFT results reveals that the exchange and correlation effects of DFT slightly enhance the extent of charge transfer and core repulsions in the water clusters. Cooperative stabilization of the cyclic water trimer and tetramer is considered by performing a many-body expansion of the interaction energy. Natural energy decomposition analysis of this expansion suggests that charge transfer is the leading source of cooperative stabilization. Polarization effects have only marginal influence on cooperativity.},

  abstract =  {An empirical method to account for van der Waals interactions in practical calculations with the density functional theory (termed DFT-D) is tested for a wide variety of molecular complexes. As in previous schemes, the dispersive energy is described by damped interatomic potentials of the form C6R−6. The use of pure, gradient-corrected density functionals (BLYP and PBE), together with the resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximation for the Coulomb operator, allows very efficient computations for large systems. Opposed to previous work, extended AO basis sets of polarized TZV or QZV quality are employed, which reduces the basis set superposition error to a negligible extend. By using a global scaling factor for the atomic C6 coefficients, the functional dependence of the results could be strongly reduced. The “double counting” of correlation effects for strongly bound complexes is found to be insignificant if steep damping functions are employed. The method is applied to a total of 29 complexes of atoms and small molecules (Ne, CH4, NH3, H2O, CH3F, N2, F2, formic acid, ethene, and ethine) with each other and with benzene, to benzene, naphthalene, pyrene, and coronene dimers, the naphthalene trimer, coronene · H2O and four H-bonded and stacked DNA base pairs (AT and GC). In almost all cases, very good agreement with reliable theoretical or experimental results for binding energies and intermolecular distances is obtained. For stacked aromatic systems and the important base pairs, the DFT-D-BLYP model seems to be even superior to standard MP2 treatments that systematically overbind. The good results obtained suggest the approach as a practical tool to describe the properties of many important van der Waals systems in chemistry. Furthermore, the DFT-D data may either be used to calibrate much simpler (e.g., force-field) potentials or the optimized structures can be used as input for more accurate ab initio calculations of the interaction energies. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract = {A new hybrid density functional for general chemistry applications is proposed. It is based on a mixing of standard generalized gradient approximations (GGAs) for exchange by Becke (B) and for correlation by Lee, Yang, and Parr (LYP) with Hartree-Fock (HF) exchange and a perturbative second-order correlation part (PT2) that is obtained from the Kohn-Sham (GGA) orbitals and eigenvalues. This virtual orbital-dependent functional contains only two global parameters that describe the mixture of HF and GGA exchange (ax) and of the PT2 and GGA correlation (c), respectively. The parameters are obtained in a least-squares-fit procedure to the G2/97 set of heat of formations. Opposed to conventional hybrid functionals, the optimum ax is found to be quite large (53\% with c = 27\%) which at least in part explains the success for many problematic molecular systems compared to conventional approaches. The performance of the new functional termed B2-PLYP is assessed by the G2/97 standard benchmark set, a second test suite of atoms, molecules, and reactions that are considered as electronically very difficult (including transition-metal compounds, weakly bonded complexes, and reaction barriers) and comparisons with other hybrid functionals of GGA and meta-GGA types. According to many realistic tests, B2-PLYP can be regarded as the best general purpose density functional for molecules (e.g., a mean absolute deviation for the two test sets of only 1.8 and 3.2 kcal/mol compared to about 3 and 5 kcal/mol, respectively, for the best other density functionals). Very importantly, also the maximum and minium errors (outliers) are strongly reduced (by about 10–20 kcal/mol). Furthermore, very good results are obtained for transition state barriers but unlike previous attempts at such a good description, this definitely comes not at the expense of equilibrium properties. Preliminary calculations of the equilibrium bond lengths and harmonic vibrational frequencies for diatomic molecules and transition-metal complexes also show very promising results. The uniformity with which B2-PLYP improves for a wide range of chemical systems emphasizes the need of (virtual) orbital-dependent terms that describe nonlocal electron correlation in accurate exchange-correlation functionals. From a practical point of view, the new functional seems to be very robust and it is thus suggested as an efficient quantum chemical method of general purpose.},

Mixed-basis EFP potentials (called ?EFPm?) for water and TBA molecules were prepared and tested in this work. The accuracy of these EFP potentials is justified by comparison of structures and binding energies in water, TBA, and water?TBA dimers with MP2/6-311++G(d,p) data. It has been found that the discrepancies between EFP and MP2 do not exceed 0.1 Å in intermolecular distances and 1 kcal/mol in binding energies. Structures of TBA?water solutions with 0.0, 0.06, 0.11, 0.16, and 0.50 TBA mole fractions were analyzed by using radial distribution functions (RDFs) and coordination numbers. These results suggest that, at low TBA concentrations, the structure of water is enhanced and water and TBA are not homogeneously mixed at the molecular level. In the equimolar TBA?water solution, the microscopic mixing is more complete. Analysis of the energy components in TBA?water solutions shows that, while the electrostatic and exchange-repulsion terms provide the largest contributions to the total potential energy, the relative importance of the polarization and dispersion terms depends on the concentration of TBA. With an increase of TBA concentration, the fraction of the dispersion energy increases, while the fraction of polarization energy diminishes. However, both polarization and dispersion terms are essential for accurate description of these systems.},

  abstract = {A recently proposed computational protocol is employed to obtain highly accurate atomization energies for the full G2/97 test set, which consists of 148 diverse molecules. This computational protocol is based on the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster method with iterative single and double excitations as well as perturbative triple excitations, using quadruple-ζ basis sets. Corrections for higher excitations and core/core-valence correlation effects are accounted for in separate calculations. In this manner, suitable reference values are obtained with a mean deviation of −0.75 kJ/mol and a standard deviation of 1.06 kJ/mol with respect to the active thermochemical tables. Often, in the literature, new approximate methods (e.g., in the area of density functional theory) are compared to, or fitted to, experimental heats of formation of the G2/97 test set. We propose to use our atomization energies for this purpose because they are more accurate on average.},

The optimal set of parameters completely neglects the contribution from antiparallel-spin electron pairs to the MP2 energy while scaling the parallel contribution by 1.76. These spin-component scaled for nucleobases (SCSN) parameters are obtained by minimizing, with respect to SCS parameters, the rms interaction energy error relative to the best available literature values, over a set of ten stacked nucleic acid base pairs. The applicability of this scaling to a wide variety of noncovalent interactions is verified through evaluation of a larger set of model complexes, including those dominated by dispersion and electrostatics.},

The functional F[n(r)] is then discussed for two situations: (1) n(r)=n0+ñ(r), ñ/n0≪1, and (2) n(r)=ϕ(r/r0) with ϕ arbitrary and r0→∞. In both cases F can be expressed entirely in terms of the correlation energy and linear and higher order electronic polarizabilities of a uniform electron gas. This approach also sheds some light on generalized Thomas-Fermi methods and their limitations. Some new extensions of these methods are presented.},

  abstract =   {Density fitting (DF) approximations have been used to increase the efficiency of several quantum mechanical methods. In this work, we apply DF and a related approach, Cholesky decomposition (CD), to wave function-based symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). We also test the one-center approximation to the Cholesky decomposition. The DF and CD approximations lead to a dramatic improvement in the overall computational cost of SAPT, while introducing negligible errors. For typical target accuracies, the Cholesky basis needed is noticeably smaller than the DF basis (although the cost of constructing the Cholesky vectors is slightly greater than that of constructing the three-index DF integrals). The SAPT program developed in this work is applied to the interactions between acenes previously studied by Grimme [Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 47, 3430 (2008)] , expanding the cases studied by adding the pentacene dimer. The SAPT decomposition of the acene interactions provides a more realistic picture of the interactions than that from the energy decomposition analysis previously reported. The data suggest that parallel-displaced and T-shaped acene dimers both feature a special stabilizing π-π interaction arising from electron correlation terms which are significantly more stabilizing than expected on the basis of pairwise −C6R−6 estimates. These terms are qualitatively the same in T-shaped as in parallel-displaced geometries, although they are roughly a factor of 2 smaller in T-shaped geometries because of the larger distances between the intermolecular pairs of electrons.},

  abstract = {Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) offers insight into the nature of intermolecular interactions. In addition, accurate energies can be obtained from the wave function-based variant of SAPT provided that intramonomer electron correlation effects are included. We apply density-fitting (DF) approximations to the intramonomer correlation corrections in SAPT. The introduction of this approximation leads to an improvement in the computational cost of SAPT by reducing the scaling of certain SAPT terms, reducing the amount of disk I/O, and avoiding the explicit computation of certain types of MO integrals. We have implemented all the intramonomer correlation corrections to SAPT through second-order under the DF approximation. Additionally, leading third-order terms are also implemented. The accuracy of this truncation of SAPT is tested against the S22 test set of Hobza and co-workers [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 (2006)] . When the intramonomer corrections to dispersion are included in SAPT, a mean absolute deviation of 0.3–0.4 kcal mol−1 is observed for the S22 test set when using an aug-cc-pVDZ basis. The computations on the adenine-thymine complexes in the S22 test set with an aug-cc-pVDZ basis represent the largest SAPT computations to date that include this degree of intramonomer correlation. Computations of this size can now be performed routinely with our newly developed DF-SAPT program.},

  abstract =   {In this paper we analyse the electronic properties of gas-phase 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium Cl ion pairs, [C4C1im]Cl, in order to deepen our understanding of ionic liquids in general. Examination of charge densities, natural bond orbitals (NBO), and delocalised molecular orbitals computed at the B3LYP and MP2/6-31++G(d,p) levels have enabled us to explain a number of experimental phenomena: the relative acidity of different sites on the imidazolium ring, variations in hydrogen-bond donor and acceptor abilities, the apparent contradiction of the hydrogen-bond-donor parameters for different types of solute, the low probability of finding a Cl− anion at the rear of the imidazolium ring and the expansion of the imidazolium ring in the presence of a strong hydrogen-bond acceptor. The unreactive but coordinating environment and large electrochemical window have also been accounted for, as has the strong electron-donating character of the carbon atoms to the rear of the ring in associated imidazolylidenes. The electronic structure of the [C4C1im]+ cation is best described by a C4C5 double bond at the rear, and a delocalised three-centre 4 e− component across the front (N1-C2-N3) of the imidazolium ring; delocalisation between these regions is also significant. Hydrogen-bond formation is driven by Coulombic stabilisation, which compensates for an associated destabilisation of the electronic part of the system. Interactions are dominated by a large positive charge at C2 and the build up of π-electron density above and below the ring, particularly that associated with the double bond between C4 and C5. The NBO partial charges have been computed and compared with those used in a number of classical simulations.},

  abstract =   {A large number of ab-initio (B3LYP/6–31++G(d,p)) computed ion-pair structures have been examined in order to determine if such calculations are capable of offering insight into the physical properties of the liquid state, particularly viscosity and melting point. Ion pairings based around the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (C4C1im) cations and a range of anions (Cl, BF4, and N(Tf)2 where N(Tf)2 is bis(trifluoromethylsulfonly)imide) were chosen because of the range of viscosities exhibited by the corresponding ionic liquids. We have used these results to build up a ‘picture’ of the ionic liquid structure which is consistent with molecular dynamics simulations and experimental evidence. However, further work is required to established if such an analysis could be predictive. Nevertheless, we establish clear relationships relating ion-pair association energy, a derived ‘connectivity index’, and the diversity of structures with viscosity and melting point. Our calculations indicate that ions in C4C1imCl form a strong, highly connected and regular array thus rationalizing the high viscosity and melting point. In contrast the ion-pairs of C4C1imN(Tf)2 form a weakly interacting, highly disordered, and low connectivity network consistent with the low viscosity and melting point. C4C1imBF4 lies midway between these two extremes.},

Based on the proton affinity equilibrium we proposed a new energetic criterion that can be used as a measure of charge delocalization. The proposed proton affinity comparison quantifies the extent to which ionic liquid anions are delocalized. Thus it should lead to a better understanding towards the design of task-specific ionic liquids. Therefore, this criterion can be applied to newly designed anions to assure that the extent of charge delocalization falls within the same range of values on the proton affinity scale as other commonly used ionic liquid anions.},

However, the complexity of the calculation has meant that it has previously not been readily available for complex structures, for example for organic salts. We propose a new robust method for calculating Madelung constants of such structures based on a generalized numerical direct summation approach. The method is applied to various organic salts from the ionic liquid and pharmaceutical fields. The values calculated are seen to be a unique feature of the crystal structure, reflecting the positioning of the ions in the unit cell and being sensitive to ion pairing. The difference in Madelung constants between different polymorphs of a compound is also shown.},

Both linear (C3v symmetry) and nonlinear (C2v symmetry) hydrogen-bonded complexes were studied. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory was used to decompose interaction energies into fundamental components such as Coulomb, repulsion, induction and dispersion to analyze the interplay among these forces in stabilizing hydrogen bonding. In the linear charged complexes, both Coulomb attraction and induction significantly contributed to the stabilization of hydrogen bonding. In the nonlinear charged complexes, mainly Coulomb attraction contributed to the HB complex stabilization, with the inductive forces playing a less important role. Contrary to the neutral complexes, dispersion forces played only a marginal role in the charged complexes. Interplay between the fundamental forces was also investigated in the ion pairs of the imidazolium-based ionic liquid, [C2mim]Cl, that were categorized as either (1) typical ion?ion interaction, with the anion interacting from above or below the imidazolium plane; or (2) hydrogen-bonding interaction, with the anion interacting with the C2?H bond of the imidazolium cation. Both types of interactions were found to induce similar charge transfers, and the analysis of the energetic components revealed only a slight difference in the ion pairs studied: (1) both interactions were electrostatically driven, between 86\% and 88\% of the overall attractive energy, with the electrostatic component being slightly lower in the hydrogen-bonded ion pairs by ?8 kJ mol?1; and (2) dispersion forces were found to be stronger in the typical ion?ion interactions by ?15 kJ mol?1 and could be possible only due to the fact that the anion was able to move closer to the cation with no steric hindrance. From the experimental point of view, a vibrational red shift is expected in the hydrogen-bonded complexes of imidazolium-based ionic liquids, whereas the ion?ion interactions are more likely to produce a slight blue shift.},

The Cnmpyr and Cnmim cations with varying alkyl chains from Methyl, Ethyl, n-Propyl to n-Butyl were combined with a wide range of routinely used IL anions such as chloride, bromide, mesylate (CH3SO3 or Mes), tosylate (CH3PhSO3 or Tos), bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide (NTf2), dicyanamide (N(CN)2 or dca), tetrafluoroborate (BF4) and hexafluorophosphate (PF6). A number of energetically favourable conformations were studied for each cation–anion combination. The interaction energy and its dispersion component of the single ion pairs were calculated using a sophisticated state-of-the-art approach: a second-order of Symmetry Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). A comparison of energetics depending on the cation–anion type, as well as the mode of interaction was performed. Dispersion forces were confirmed to be of importance for the overall stabilisation of ionic liquids contributing from 28 kJ mol−1 in pyrrolidinium ion pairs to 59 kJ mol−1 in imidazolium ion pairs. The previously proposed ratio of total interaction energy to dispersion components and melting points was assessed for this set of ionic liquids and was found to correlate with their melting points for the anionic series, producing separate trends for the Cnmim and Cmpyr series of cations. Chlorides, bromides and tetrafluoroborates formed close-to-ideal correlations when both types of cations, Cnmim and Cnmpyr, were combined in the same trend. Correlation of the dispersion component of the interaction energy with transport properties such as conductivity and viscosity was also considered. For imidazolium-based ionic liquids strong linear correlations were obtained, whereas pyrrolidinium ionic liquids appeared to be insensitive to this correlation.},

The computational cost of the method scales quadratically as a function of the number of fragments (monomers), but could be made to scale linearly by exploiting distance-dependent thresholds. Extensive benchmark calculations are reported using the S22 database of high-level ab initio binding energies for dimers, and we find that average errors can be reduced to {\textbackslash}textless1 kcal/mol with a suitable choice of basis set. Comparison to ab initio benchmarks for water clusters as large as (H2O)20 demonstrates that the method recovers ≳90\% of the binding energy in these systems, at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. As such, this approach represents a promising path toward accurate, systematically improvable, and parameter-free simulation of molecular liquids.},

  abstract = {The optimal set of scaling parameters that minimize the error between spin-component scaled (SCS-MP2) and scaled opposite spin (SOS-MP2) theories and CCSD(T) in computing intermolecular binding energies were determined using multivariate linear least squares analysis. Counterpoise corrected intermolecular binding energies among a diverse test set of hydrogen bonded, dispersion, and mixed complexes (S22 training set) were obtained using RI-MP2 theory and the cc-pVXZ (X = D, T, and Q) and the extrapolated cc-pV(XY)Z (XY = D → T, T → Q) atomic orbital basis set series. Optimization of the opposite spin-component scaling parameter yielded the SOS(MI)-MP2 model, with the ability to outperform RI-MP2 theory in obtaining accurate intermolecular binding energies among dispersion complexes with only fourth-order computational effort. At the extrapolated cc-pV(DT)Z and cc-pV(TQ)Z levels, for example, intermolecular binding energies among dispersion complexes were computed with RMS errors of 1.00 kcal/mol and 0.87 kcal/mol, respectively, thereby allowing for accurate treatment of prohibitively large molecular systems at a fraction of the computational cost associated with standard RI-MP2 calculations. With both spin-component scaling parameters optimized, the resultant model, SCS(MI)-MP2, emerged as a highly accurate methodology that simultaneously corrects the MP2 errors associated with hydrogen bonded and dispersion complexes. Computations at the extrapolated SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pV(DT)Z level yielded RMS errors of 0.31 kcal/mol, and therefore represented a computationally efficient method for obtaining intermolecular binding energies with quadruple-ζ accuracy. With scaling parameters that are essentially inverted with respect to their original recommended values, namely, cOS = 0.40 and cSS = 1.29, intermolecular binding energies computed at the SCS(MI)-MP2/cc-pV(TQ)Z level of theory were found to be within 0.25 kcal/mol of the highest level CCSD(T) benchmarks available to date. Surprisingly, it was found that scaling only the same spin-component of the MP2 energy (SSS(MI)-MP2) leads to significant decreases in the errors associated with MP2 theory in computing intermolecular binding energies. These findings, coupled with the earlier work on SOS-MP2 theory, strongly suggest that the MP2 description of bond energies contains a systematically underestimated opposite spin-component and a simultaneously overestimated same spin-component, while the reverse appears generally true for intermolecular interactions.},

The CCSD(T) correction term, determined as a difference between CCSD(T) and MP2 interaction energies, is evaluated with smaller basis sets (6-31G** and cc-pVDZ). Two sets of complex geometries were used, optimized or experimental ones. The JSCH-2005 benchmark set, which is now available to the chemical community, can be used for testing lower-level computational methods. For the first screening the smaller training set (S22) containing 22 model complexes can be recommended. In this case larger basis sets were used for extrapolation to the CBS limit and also CCSD(T) and counterpoise-corrected MP2 optimized geometries were sometimes adopted.},

Two different starting conditions lead to two trajectories from which we harvest structural data. For both simulations, we find large anions within the equilibrium phase:? In both trajectories at longer simulation time, the anion size converges to four monomer units, i.e., to Al4Cl13-. The cluster size fluctuations indicate that Grotthus diffusion must play a role. We discuss one possible mechanism of such a reaction changing the anionic species. This process involves many steps of chlorine rattling, bond breaking, and bond forming. With the aid of the electron localization function, a probable rationale for the formation of larger anions is determined:? Large anionic species are formed simply to account for the ?lack of electrons? present in the acidic melt.},

In the first-year quantum chemistry course at this university, it was noticed that many students lack basic mathematical knowledge. To tackle the mathematics problem, a remedial mathematics program was set up . Each week students were provided online assignments that would prepare them for the upcoming quantum chemistry lecture. This should also facilitate the needed mathematical transfer from calculus to quantum chemistry. The lecturer closely monitored the progress of the students and gave feedback. The mathematical skills of the students improved as a result of the remedial mathematics program. Students could better follow the quantum chemistry lectures than previous years and they were more involved during the course. Unfortunately, the percentage of students passing the quantum chemistry exam did not change substantially. The following year adjustments were made to the remedial program and the quantum chemistry course, resulting in better grades. Proper mathematical skills appear to be indispensable, but are not sufficient for understanding quantum chemistry.},

  abstract = {The symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) has been employed to calculate an accurate potential energy curve for the helium dimer. For major components of the interaction energy, saturated values have been obtained using extended Gaussian-type geminal bases. Some other, less significant components were computed using a large orbital basis and the standard set of SAPT codes. The remaining small fraction of the interaction energy has been obtained using a nonstandard SAPT program specific for two-electron monomers and the supermolecular full configuration interaction (FCI) calculations in a moderately large orbital basis. Accuracy of the interaction energy components has been carefully examined. The most accurate to date values of the electrostatic, exchange, induction, and dispersion energies are reported for distances from 3.0 to 7.0 bohr. After adding the retardation correction predicted by the Casimir theory, our new potential has been shown [A. R. Janzen and R. A. Aziz (submitted)] to recover the known bulk and scattering data for helium more accurately than other existing ab initio and empirical potentials. However, the calculated dissociation energy of 1.713 mK and the bond length of 45.8 Å differ somewhat from the values inferred recently from a transmission experiment using nanoscale sieves.},

  abstract =  {Knowledge of the ionicity of the phosphorane intermediate is important to the analysis of the microscopic mechanism of the hydrolysis of the phosphate ester bond by ribonuclease A (RNase A). Five-coordinate uridine vanadate, an analog of the phosphorane, binds to RNase A as the monoanion. The absorption spectra of the vanadate is a probe of the electronic structure of the active site. An in vacuo theoretical model of H4VO5− is calculated to have transitions only in the far ultraviolet (UV). However, H2VO5C2H4− has one in the near UV as well as others further into the UV. The transition energy of the monoanion calculated in the field of the protein active site with effective fragment potentials shifts modestly to the red. Broad monoanion absorptions are predicted which would overlap an observed incomplete very broad absorption attributed to the complex of uridine vanadate with RNase A. The absorption bands of neutral ethylene glycol vanadate are predicted to be further to the red but also overlap the experimental absorption. © 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

  abstract =   {We have developed a simple and quantitative explanation for the relatively low melting temperatures of ionic liquids (ILs). The basic concept was to assess the Gibbs free energy of fusion (?fusG) for the process IL(s) ? IL(l), which relates to the melting point of the IL. This was done using a suitable Born?Fajans?Haber cycle that was closed by the lattice (i.e., IL(s) ? IL(g)) Gibbs energy and the solvation (i.e., IL(g) ? IL(l)) Gibbs energies of the constituent ions in the molten salt. As part of this project we synthesized and determined accurate melting points (by DSC) and dielectric constants (by dielectric spectroscopy) for 14 ionic liquids based on four common anions and nine common cations. Lattice free energies (?lattG) were estimated using a combination of Volume Based Thermodynamics (VBT) and quantum chemical calculations. Free energies of solvation (?solvG) of each ion in the bulk molten salt were calculated using the COSMO solvation model and the experimental dielectric constants. Under standard ambient conditions (298.15 K and 105 Pa) ?fusG° was found to be negative for all the ILs studied, as expected for liquid samples. Thus, these ILs are liquid under standard ambient conditions because the liquid state is thermodynamically favorable, due to the large size and conformational flexibility of the ions involved, which leads to small lattice enthalpies and large entropy changes that favor melting. This model can be used to predict the melting temperatures and dielectric constants of ILs with good accuracy. A comparison of the predicted vs experimental melting points for nine of the ILs (excluding those where no melting transition was observed and two outliers that were not well described by the model) gave a standard error of the estimate (sest) of 8 °C. A similar comparison for dielectric constant predictions gave sest as 2.5 units. Thus, from very little experimental and computational data it is possible to predict fundamental properties such as melting points and dielectric constants of ionic liquids.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the extent of hole delocalization in one-electron oxidized adenine (A) and guanine (G) stacks and shows that new IR vibrational bands are predicted that are characteristic of hole delocalization within A-stacks. The geometries of A-stacks (Ai; i = 2?8) and G-stacks (GG and GGG) in their neutral and one-electron oxidized states were optimized with the bases in a B-DNA conformation using the M06-2X/6-31G* method. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) is localized on a single adenine in A-stacks and on a single guanine in GG and GGG stacks located at the 5?-site of the stack. On one-electron oxidation (removal of an electron from the HOMO of the neutral A- and G-stacks) a ?hole? is created. Mulliken charge analysis shows that these ?holes? are delocalized over two to three adenine bases in the A-stack. The calculated spin density distribution of Ai?+ (i = 2?8) also showed delocalization of the hole predominantly on two adenine bases, with some delocalization on a neighboring base. For GG and GGG radical cations, the hole was found to be localized on a single G in the stack. The calculated HFCCs of GG and GGG are in good agreement with the experiment. Further, from the vibrational frequency analysis, it was found that IR spectra of neutral and the corresponding one-electron oxidized adenine stacks are quite different. The IR spectra of A2?+ has intense IR peaks between 900 and 1500 cm?1 that are not present in the neutral A2 stack. The presence of A2?+ in the adenine stack has a characteristic intense peak at ?1100 cm?1. Thus, IR and Raman spectroscopy has potential for monitoring the extent of hole delocalization in A stacks.},

In this method, a discrete amount of charge is transferred for each hydrogen bond formed. It is designed to be simple to implement, to be applicable to a variety of potential models, and to satisfy various physical requirements. The method does not transfer charge at large intramolecular distances, it does not result in a conductive liquid, and it can be easily parameterized to give the correct amount of charge transfer. Two charge transfermodels are developed for a polarizable and a non-polarizable potential. The models reproduce many of the properties of liquid water, including the structure, the diffusion constant, and thermodynamic properties over a range of temperatures.},

  abstract = {The intermediate bond forces in ionic liquids are investigated from static quantum chemical calculations at various methods and two basis sets. The experimentally observed red-shift of the donor-proton bond stretching frequency due to a bond elongation is confirmed by all methods. Comparing Hartree–Fock to second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory, the Hartree–Fock method gives in many cases an erroneous description of the geometries. Furthermore, the Hartree–Fock interaction energies can deviate up to 60 kJ mol−1 from Møller–Plesset perturbation theory indicating the importance of dispersion interaction. While the usual trends of decreasing stability or interaction energies with increasing ion sizes are found, the geometries involving hydrogen atoms do not change this order of total interaction energies. Therefore, the hydrogen bond is not the most important interaction for ion pairs with regard to the total interaction energy. On the other hand, the different established analysis methods give rise to hydrogen bonding in several ion pairs. Charge analysis reveals the hydrogen-bonding character of the ion pair and shows, depending on the type of ions combined and further on the type of conformers considered, that a hydrogen bond can be present. The possibility of hydrogen bonding is also shown by an analysis of the frontier orbitals. Calculating potential energy surfaces and observing from this the change in the donor proton bond indicates that regular hydrogen bonds are possible in ion pairs of ionic liquids. Thereby, the maximum of bond elongation exceeds the one of a usual hydrogen bond by far. The more salt-like hydrogen-bonded ion pair [NH4][BF4] exhibits a steeper maximum than the more ionic liquid like ion pair [EtNH3][BF4]. The fact that imidazolium-based ionic liquids as [Emim][Cl] can display two faces, hydrogen bonding and purely ionic bonding, points to a disturbing rather than stabilizing role of hydrogen bonding on the interaction of the counterions in imidazolium-based ionic liquids. While geometry and charge analysis provides attributes of weak (blue-shifted) hydrogen bonds, large bond elongations accompanied by red-shifts are obtained for the ion pairs investigated. This can be understood by the simple fact that these imidazolium-based ionic liquid ion pairs constitute weak hydrogen bonds placed between two delocalized charges.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for expressing the occupied self-consistent-field (SCF) orbitals of a molecule exactly in terms of chemically deformed atomic minimal-basis-set orbitals that deviate as little as possible from free-atom SCF minimal-basis orbitals. The molecular orbitals referred to are the exact SCF orbitals, the free-atom orbitals referred to are the exact atomic SCF orbitals, and the formulation of the deformed “quasiatomic minimal-basis-sets” is independent of the calculational atomic orbital basis used. The resulting resolution of molecular orbitals in terms of quasiatomic minimal basis set orbitals is therefore intrinsic to the exact molecular wave functions. The deformations are analyzed in terms of interatomic contributions. The Mulliken population analysis is formulated in terms of the quasiatomic minimal-basis orbitals. In the virtual SCF orbital space the method leads to a quantitative ab initio formulation of the qualitative model of virtual valence orbitals, which are useful for calculating electron correlation and the interpretation of reactions. The method is applicable to Kohn–Sham density functional theory orbitals and is easily generalized to valence MCSCF orbitals.},

Other forces, such as gravitational, nuclear or magnetic forces, are negligible either because their intensity is sensibly smaller (as for the case of magnetic or gravitational forces) or because they are extremely short-ranged (as for nuclear forces) [1]. The intermolecular forces can be derived from a potential (the intermolecular potential) which can be defined in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation [2, 3], where the motion of the electrons is separated from the slow motion of the nuclei, and the molecular energy E(q) = Ee(q) + EN is studied for a given configuration q of the nuclei. E(q) defines a molecular potential surface, independent of the velocity of the nuclei, the latter moving so as to satisfy the nuclear wave equation},

Semi-empirical structures (AM1 and PM3) are similar to those obtained from ab initio methods. The non-bonded interactions in these ion pairs are of the C–H⋯X type (C–H⋯F hydrogen bonds) and exist between F's on PF6− and (a) the imidazolium ring N–H, (b) the methyl group H adjacent to the ring and (c) H's on the butyl (bmim+) side chain. The ab initio ion pair structures contain hydrogen bonds that shorten with increasing basis set complexity. The movement of the bmim+ imidazolium ring C2–H along the proton transfer coordinate towards PF6− produces similar anharmonic functions for the RHF/6-31G∗//6-31G∗∗, MP2/6-31G∗//6-31G∗∗, RHF/6-31G∗∗/6-31+G(d,p)//6-31G∗∗, MP2/6-31G∗∗/6-31+G(d,p)//6-31G∗∗, B3LYP/6-31G∗//6-31G∗∗ and B3LYP/6-31G∗∗/6-31+G(d,p)//6-31G∗∗ levels.

  abstract =   {This paper contains a study of the pair and many-body interactions in cyclic water clusters:? trimer, tetramer, and pentamer. Symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) is applied to compute the pair- and three-body interactions directly and to analyze the individual electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange contributions. The total interaction energies are also obtained by supermolecule coupled-cluster calculations including single, double, and noniterative triple excitations, CCSD(T). The three-body interactions contribute up to 28\% of the total interaction energy in these water clusters in their equilibrium geometries and up to 50\% of the barriers for different tunneling processes investigated in the trimer. The main three-body contribution is due to second- and third-order induction effects, but also three-body exchange effects are substantial. Dispersion contributions are only significant in the pair energy. The four-body effects are relatively small, and the five-body effects were found to be negligible. Furthermore, we tested the quality of various density functional methods for describing these many-body interactions.},

  abstract = {We have developed a parallelized integral-direct code of the perturbative doubles correction for configuration interaction with singles, proposed as CIS(D) by Head-Gordon et al. (Chem Phys Lett 219:21, 1994). The CIS(D) method provides the energy corrections both of the relaxation and differential correlation for the respective CIS excited states. The implementation of CIS(D) is based on our original algorithm for the second-order Møller–Plesset perturbation (MP2) calculations (Mochizuki et al. in Theor Chem Acc 112:442, 2004). There is no need to communicate bulky intermediate data among worker processes of the parallelized execution. This CIS(D) code is then incorporated into a developer version of ABINIT-MP program, in order to improve the overestimation in excitation energies calculated by the CIS method in conjunction with the multilayer fragment molecular orbital scheme (MLFMO-CIS) (Mochizuki et al. in Chem Phys Lett 406:283, 2005). The MLFMO-CIS(D) method is first used in evaluating the lowest n π∗{\textbackslash}textbackslashpiˆ\{*\} excitation energy of the hydrated formaldehyde. The photoactive yellow protein (PYP) is the second target of MLFMO-CIS(D) calculation. Through these applications, it is shown that the CIS(D) correction improves the CIS results favorably.},

The magnitude and the effect of the basis set superposition error (BSSE) were carefully investigated. We found that going up to aug-cc-pVDZ and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets is enough to obtain accurate CBS MP2 energies when BSSE corrected values are used but aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets are needed when the BSSE uncorrected total energies are used in CBS extrapolations. MP2 interaction energies with smaller basis sets such as 6 - 31 G ∗ are found to have very little dispersion energy and that the true source of dispersion attributed attractive interactions is almost entirely due to BSSE. MP2 and CCSD(T) CBS interaction energies are found to be very close to one another if aromatic systems are not involved. Comparative analyses have been performed with semiempirical and ab initio methods utilizing the moderate in size but affordable 6 - 31 G ∗ basis set both of which can be readily applied to macromolecular systems. The new M06-2X and M06-L DFT functionals were found to be more accurate than all methods tested herein. Interaction energy curves using the SG1 grid showed discontinuities for several of the dimer systems but this problem disappeared when finer DFT numerical grids were used.},

  abstract = {We present an extension of many-body symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT) by including all third-order polarization and exchange contributions obtained with the neglect of intramonomer correlation effects. The third-order polarization energy, which naturally decomposes into the induction, dispersion, and mixed, induction-dispersion components, is significantly quenched at short range by electron exchange effects. We propose a decomposition of the total third-order exchange energy into the exchange-induction, exchange-dispersion, and exchange-induction-dispersion contributions which provide the quenching for the corresponding individual polarization contributions. All components of the third-order energy have been expressed in terms of molecular integrals and orbital energies. The obtained formulas, valid for both dimer- and monomer-centered basis sets, have been implemented within the general closed-shell many-electron SAPT program. Test calculations for several small dimers have been performed and their results are presented. For dispersion-bound dimers, the inclusion of the third-order effects eliminates the need for a hybrid SAPT approach, involving supermolecular Hartree-Fock calculations. For dimers consisting of strongly polar monomers, the hybrid approach remains more accurate. It is shown that, due to the extent of the quenching, the third-order polarization effects should be included only together with their exchange counterparts. Furthermore, the latter have to be calculated exactly, rather than estimated by scaling the second-order values.},

Macroscopic bubble and droplet experiments have been interpreted to indicate an air–water interface covered with hydroxide, whereas recent molecular-scale studies produce the opposite conclusion, viz. that hydroxide is repelled from the interface while hydronium is strongly adsorbed. Here we report results from resonant UV second harmonic generation (SHG) experiments that are best modeled by surface depletion of hydroxide and establish at most a weak surface adsorption. This finding is consistent with our earlier SHG measurements indicating surface enhancement of hydrated protons, as well as with other molecular-scale experiments and simulations, but stands in stark contrast to the results from macroscopic studies. The acidity, or basicity, of aqueous surfaces could strongly influence heterogeneous atmospheric chemical processes, such as aerosol reactions and gas uptake.},

  abstract = {Total intermolecular interactionenergies are determined with a first version of the Gaussian electrostatic model (GEM-0), a force field based on a density fitting approach using s -type Gaussian functions. The total interactionenergy is computed in the spirit of the sum of interacting fragment ab initio (SIBFA) force field by separately evaluating each one of its components: electrostatic (Coulomb), exchange repulsion, polarization, and charge transferintermolecular interactionenergies, in order to reproduce reference constrained space orbital variation (CSOV) energy decomposition calculations at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level. The use of an auxiliary basis set restricted to spherical Gaussian functions facilitates the rotation of the fitted densities of rigid fragments and enables a fast and accurate density fitting evaluation of Coulomb and exchange-repulsion energy, the latter using the overlap model introduced by Wheatley and Price [Mol. Phys.69, 50718 (1990)]. The SIBFA energy scheme for polarization and charge transfer has been implemented using the electric fields and electrostatic potentials generated by the fitted densities. GEM-0 has been tested on ten stationary points of the water dimer potential energy surface and on three waterclusters ( n = 16 , 20 , 64 ) . The results show very good agreement with density functional theory calculations, reproducing the individual CSOV energy contributions for a given interaction as well as the B3LYP total interactionenergies with errors below k B T at room temperature. Preliminary results for Coulomb and exchange-repulsion energies of metal cation complexes and coupled cluster singles doubles electron densities are discussed.},

Once the crystal structures which are thermodynamically feasible have been obtained, then comparison with the experimentally known polymorphs can provide interesting insights into crystallization behaviour.

  abstract = {The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to find that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize ?all? solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reflects and to an increasing extent ?predicts? the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under ?blind test? conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and π?π stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.},

  abstract =   {With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.},

  abstract = {Spin-component scaled second-order M?ller?Plesset perturbation theory (SCS-MP2) energy calculations, which independently scale the opposite- and same-spin components of the MP2 correlation energy, are known to consistently provide improved interaction energies in comparison to conventional MP2. This has led to the development of a number of SCS-MP2 derivatives that target particular classes of molecules, interactions or properties. In this study, SCS-MP2 scaling coefficients targeted to interaction energies of single ion pair semi-Coulombic ionic liquid (IL) systems are presented in view of circumventing the need for counterpoise correction to eliminate basis set superposition error (BSSE). A set of 174 IL ion pairs consisting of imidazolium ([C(1?4)mim]+) and pyrrolidinium ([C(1?4)mpyr]+) cations and routinely used anions such as Br?, Cl?, [BF4]?, [PF6]?, [DCA]? (dicyanamide), [tos]? (tosylate), [mes]? (mesylate), and [NTf2]? (bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide), each of which were arranged in multiple favorable conformations, were calculated at the MP2 level of theory with 17 popular basis sets ranging from double- to quadruple-? quality and at the CCSD(T)/CBS limit. For each basis set, the spin components of the IL set were scaled via least-squares multiple linear regression with respect to CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark interaction energies that were corrected for BSSE using the Boys and Bernardi approach. SCS-MP2 spin component coefficients of 1.05 and 0.68 are recommended for the opposite- and same-spin components, respectively, in conjunction with Dunning?s cc-pVTZ basis set, which resulted in the most statistically reliable regression. Alternatively, a scaled opposite-spin MP2 (SOS-MP2) scaling factors of 1.64 is recommended for the opposite-spin component and should be used where the omission of the same-spin component results in a calculation speed-up. These two scaling schemes are termed SCS-IL-MP2 and SOS-IL-MP2, respectively. The SCS-IL-MP2 and SOS-IL-MP2 approaches show interaction energy errors on average less than 1.0 kJ mol?1 with respect to CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark results and highlights the important consideration of basis set dependence when selecting spin-component coefficients. By calculating multiple conformations for each ion pair and scaling to reproduce BSSE corrected benchmark energies, it is suggested that improved energies may be obtained for larger IL clusters beyond ion pairs without performing costly counterpoise corrections.},

  abstract = {Accurate energetics of intermolecular interactions in condensed systems are challenging to predict using highly correlated quantum chemical methods due to their great computational expense. Semi-Coulomb systems such as ionic liquids, in which electrostatic, dispersion, and induction forces are equally important, represent a further challenge for wave function-based methods. Here, the application of our recently developed SCS-IL-MP2 and SOS-IL-MP2 methods is reported for ionic liquid clusters of two and four ion pairs. Correlation interaction energies were found to be within 1.5 kJ mol?1, on average, per ion pair of the CCSD(T)/CBS benchmark, thus introducing a marked improvement by a factor of 4 to conventional MP2 within the complete basis set. The fragment molecular orbital (FMO) approach in combination with both SCS-IL-MP2 and SOS-IL-MP2 has been shown to provide a reliable and computationally inexpensive alternative to CCSD(T)/CBS for large-scale calculations of ionic liquids, thus paving the way toward feasible ab initio molecular dynamics and development of reliable force fields for these condensed systems.},

These components include the classical electrical (static and induced) and quantum mechanical core (σ?σ) and charge transfer (σ?σ*) interactions. The electrical component is, in turn, represented by three terms:? the static interaction of unperturbed fragment charge densities, a contribution involving polarized charge densities, and an electrical self polarization energy. Extended basis set calculations demonstrate the high numerical stability of the three-component NEDA approach. Applications are presented for the Li+(H2O) and water dimer complexes. The long-range behavior of the interaction potentials of these complexes is entirely determined by the classical electrical interaction of the fragments. Core and charge transfer effects are only significant for molecular separations within roughly 1 Å of equilibrium.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed calculation of partial charges for the 1,3-dimethylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid. We first analyze MP2 electronic structure calculations and DFT results on isolated ion pairs with various methods of assigning partial charges to the atomic centers. In a second run we analyze the trajectory of a 25 ps long Car?Parrinello MD run of 30 ion pairs under bulk conditions using a charge fitting procedure due to Blöchl. Both, the single ion pair and the bulk system, provide us with a similar total ionic charge considerably less than unity. Especially the liquid state DFT results give convincing evidence for a reduced ionic charge on the ions. The similarity of both results suggest that the delocalization of the Cl charge is due only to local interactions. The relevance of our results is 2-fold; on the one hand they shed light on the basic property of the liquid and its reduced ionic character, and on the other hand, the ab initio derived partial charges provide a fundamental theoretical basis for the recent attempts to use the total ionic charge as an adjustable parameter. Furthermore, all our partial charges are subject to large fluctuations, hinting to the importance of polarization effects.},

  abstract =   {State-of-the-art electronic structure theory has been applied to generate potential energy curves for the sandwich, T-shaped, and parallel-displaced configurations of the simplest prototype of aromatic π?π interactions, the benzene dimer. Results were obtained using second-order M?ller?Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) and coupled-cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)] with different augmented, correlation-consistent basis sets. At the MP2 level, the smallest basis set used (a modified aug-cc-pVDZ basis) underestimates the binding by ?0.5 kcal mol-1 at equilibrium and by ?1 kcal mol-1 at smaller intermonomer distances compared to results with a modified aug-cc-pVQZ basis (denoted aug-cc-pVQZ*). The best MP2 binding energies differ from the more accurate CCSD(T) values by up to 2.0 kcal mol-1 at equilibrium and by more than 2.5 kcal mol-1 at smaller intermonomer distances, highlighting the importance of going beyond MP2 to achieve higher accuracy in binding energies. Symmetry adapted perturbation theory is used to analyze interaction energies in terms of electrostatic, dispersion, induction, and exchange-repulsion contributions. The high-quality estimates of the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVQZ* potential energy curves for the benzene dimer presented here provide a better understanding of how the strength of π?π interactions varies with distance and orientation of the rings and will assist in the development of approximate methods capable of modeling weakly bound π?π systems.},

In particular, π?π interactions, which are ubiquitous in biological systems, are not fully understood in terms of their strength, geometrical dependence, substituent effects, or fundamental physical nature. However, state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods are beginning to provide answers to these questions. Coupled-cluster theory through perturbative triple excitations in conjunction with large basis sets and extrapolations to the complete basis set limit have provided definitive results for the binding energy of several configurations of the benzene dimer, and benchmark-quality ab initio potential curves are being used to calibrate new density functional and force-field models for π?π interactions. Studies of substituted benzene dimers indicate flaws in the conventional wisdom about substituent effects in π?π interactions. Three-body and four-body interactions in benzene clusters have also been examined.},

  abstract =   {Evaluation of the electrostatic energy within the effective fragment potential (EFP) method is presented. The performance of two variants of the distributed multipole analysis (DMA) together with two different models for estimating the charge penetration energies was studied using six homonuclear dimers. The importance of damping the higher order multipole terms, i.e. charge dipole, was also investigated. Damping corrections recover more than 70\% of the charge penetration energy in all dimers, whereas higher order damping introduces only minor improvement. Electrostatic energies calculated by the numerical DMA are less accurate than those calculated by the analytic DMA. Analysis of bonding in the benzene dimer shows that EFP with inclusion of the electrostatic damping term performs very well compared to the high-level coupled cluster singles, doubles, and perturbative triples method. The largest error of 0.4 kcal/mol occurs for the sandwich dimer configuration. This error is about half the size of the corresponding error in second order perturbation theory. Thus, EFP in the current implementation is an accurate and computationally inexpensive method for calculating interaction energies in weakly bonded molecular complexes. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The EFP method accurately predicts structures and binding energies in the water?benzene complexes. Benzene is polarizable and consequently participates in hydrogen bond networking of water. Since the water?benzene interactions are only slightly weaker than water?water interactions, structures with different numbers of water?water, benzene?water, and benzene?benzene bonds often have very similar binding energies.

One of the first requirements to initiate the molecular modeling of molecular materials is an accurate and realistic description of the electronic structure, intermolecular interactions and chemical reactions at microscopic and macroscopic scale. Therefore the first four chapters contain an extensive introduction into the latest theories of intermolecular interactions, functional density techniques, microscopic and mezoscopic modeling techniques as well as first-principle molecular dynamics. In the following chapters, techniques bridging microscopic and mezoscopic modeling scales are presented. The authors then illustrate various successful applications of molecular design of new materials, drugs, biocatalysts, etc. before presenting challenging topics in molecular materials design.},

  abstract = {Potential derived (PD) atomic charges, obtained by fitting to molecular electrostatic potentials, are widely used in molecular modeling and simulation calculations. These charges are known to depend on the sample of points chosen for the fit, on the particular point selection algorithm, on molecular translations and rotations in many instances, and even on molecular conformation. Following a critique of currently available methods, a novel point selection scheme is described which results in a highly isotropic array of points located on a series of fused-sphere van der Waals surfaces. The pattern of points is based on tesselations of the icosahedron, and these are discussed in some detail along with their connection with virus morphology, geodesic domes, and symmetric fullerene structures. Using methanol as a test case, it is shown that the new method leads to PD charges which are independent of translation and display minimal rotational dependence, and are hence far better suited to the determination of PD charges from electrostatic potentials obtained from both theory and experimental X-ray diffraction data. The conformation dependence of the newly derived PD charges for alanyl dipeptide is found to be substantially less than obtained earlier by Williams [Biopolymers29, 1367 (1990)]. © 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

  abstract = {Neutral and charged assemblies of π-conjugated molecules span the field of organic electronics. Electronic structure computations can provide valuable information regarding the nature of the intermolecular interactions within molecular precursors to organic electronics. Here, we introduce a database of neutral (Pi29n) and radical (Orel26rad) dimer complexes that represent binding energies between organic functional units. The new benchmarks are used to test approximate electronic structure methods. Achieving accurate interaction energies for neutral complexes (Pi29n) is straightforward, so long as dispersion interactions are properly taken into account. However, π-dimer radical cations (Orel26rad) are examples of highly challenging situations for density functional approximations. The role of dispersion corrections is crucial, yet simultaneously long-range corrected exchange schemes are necessary to provide the proper dimer dissociation behavior. Nevertheless, long-range corrected functionals seriously underestimate the binding energy of Orel26rad at equilibrium geometries. In fact, only ?B97X-D, an empirical exchange-correlation functional fitted together with an empirical ?classical? dispersion correction, leads to suitable results. Valuable alternatives are the more demanding MP2/6-31G*(0.25) level, as well as the most cost-effective combination involving a dispersion corrected long-range functional together with a smaller practical size basis set (e.g., LC-?PBEB95-dDsC/6-31G*). The Orel26rad test set should serve as an ideal benchmark for assessing the performance of improved schemes.},

It appears that the only reasonable physical interpretation of many-body interactions comes from perturbation theory that treats separated monomers as the zeroth-order approximation. In such theory, it is possible to split the interaction energy into several contributions that can be related to distinct physical mechanisms, such as the electrostatic, induction, dispersion, and exchange interactions. To describe the latter interactions, one has to include in this theory some symmetry projectors, leading to the name symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). For pair interactions, the shapes of potential energy surfaces are resulting from a balancing act between induction and dispersion forces which are always attractive, exchange forces which are always repulsive, and the electrostatic forces that can be of either sign but for polar molecules provide large attractive contributions in the regions of potential minima.},

  abstract = {The S22 test set of interactionenergies for small model complexes [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)] has been very valuable for benchmarking new and existing methods for noncovalent interactions. However, the basis sets utilized to compute the CCSD(T) interactionenergies for some of the dimers are insufficient to obtain converged results. Here we consistently extrapolate all CCSD(T)/complete basis set (CBS) interactionenergies using larger basis sets for the CCSD(T) component of the computation. The revised values, which we designate S22A, represent the most accurate results to date for this set of dimers. The new values appear to be within a few hundredths of 1 kcal mol − 1 of the true CCSD(T)/CBS limit at the given geometries, but the former S22 values are off by as much as 0.6 kcal mol − 1 compared to the revised values. Because some of the most promising methods for noncovalent interactions are already achieving this level of agreement (or better) compared to the S22 data, more accurate benchmark values would clearly be helpful. The MP2, SCS-MP2, SCS-CCSD, SCS(MI)-MP2, and B2PLYP-D methods have been tested against the more accurate benchmark set. The B2PLYP-D method outperforms all other methods tested here, with a mean average deviation of only 0.12 kcal mol − 1 . However, the consistent, slight underestimation of the interactionenergies computed by the SCS-CCSD method (an overall mean absolute deviation and mean deviation of 0.24 and − 0.23 kcal mol − 1 , respectively) suggests that the SCS-CCSD method has the potential to become even more accurate with a reoptimization of its parameters for noncovalent interactions.},

Despite the structural picture, the hydrogen bond dynamics at H2 is found to decay faster than the according dynamics at the H4 and H5 proton. Neglecting the directionality provides a dynamics which reflects the geometrical analysis. Two movements are identified. First, a fast ({\textbackslash}textless0.3 ps) hopping of the anion above and below the imidazolium ring and second translational motion of the anion away from the cation in-plane of the imidazolium ring (5?10 ps).},

Understanding inclusion complexes represents one of the cutting edges of simulation sciences. In this tutorial review, we focus on the role and composition of non-covalent interactions, which are essential when studying inclusion complexes. A selected set of recently developed pragmatic methods used to study inclusion complexes are then surveyed including e.g. dispersion corrected DFT, double-hybrid functionals and spin-component scaled MP2. Finally, three case studies are outlined: (a) endohedral fullerene complexes, (b) buckyball catcher and (c) resorcinarene capsule. These case studies were carefully chosen to help illustrate how one may accurately investigate inclusion complexes, at a modest computational cost, using state-of-the-art quantum chemical methods (67 references).},

  abstract =  {A recently developed method for generating distributed, localized atomic polarizabilities from the ab initio molecular charge density is used to assess the importance of the induction energy in crystal structures of small organic molecules. Two models are first contrasted based on large cluster representing the crystalline environment: one using the polarizability model in which induced multipoles are evaluated in response to the electrostatic field due to atomic multipoles; the other is a complementary procedure in which the same cluster is represented by atomic point-charges and the molecular charge density is calculated ab initio in this environment. The comparable results of these two methods show that the contribution to the lattice energy from the induction term can differ significantly between polymorphic forms, for a selection of organic crystal structures including carbamazepine and oxalyl dihydrazide, and 3-azabicyclo[3,3,1]nonane-2,4-dione. The observed charge density polarization of naphthalene in the crystalline state is also reproduced. This demonstrates that explicit inclusion of the induction energy, rather than its absorption into an empirically fitted repulsion-dispersion potential, will improve the relative ordering of the lattice energies for computed structures, and that it needs to be included in crystal structure prediction. Hence, the distributed atomic polarizability model was coded into the lattice-energy minimization program DMACRYS (which was developed as a Fortran90 recoding of DMAREL) to allow the induction energy to be calculated.},

  abstract = {The hydrogen ion is one of the most important species in aqueous solutions, as well as in protic ionic liquids (PILs). PILs are important potential alternatives to H2O for swelling the proton exchange membranes (PEMs) and improving the high-temperature performance of fuel cells. The hydrogen ion (H+) or hydronium (H3O+) solvation mechanism is not only a fundamental principle of acid/base chemistry in ionic liquids but also key to understanding the charge- and proton-transport properties of the PIL solutions. In this paper, a PIL system was prepared by mixing 1-butyl-3-methyl-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate (BMIBF4) IL with an aqueous solution of a strong acid, HBF4. Water can be partially evaporated from the solution under a vacuum at room temperature. Conductivity and vibrational spectroscopy (IR and Raman) measurements were used in combination with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to characterize the molecular-level solvation of H+ and H2O in the IL solution. When water is present at high molar fraction, the cations (BMI+ and H+) and anions (BF4?) are both solvated by water and the solutions have high conductivity. After water evaporation, the PIL solution has excess H+ and reduced conductivity, which is still significantly higher than that of pure BMIBF4. Vibrational spectroscopy suggests that the BMI+ and BF4? ions are desolvated from water during the water evaporation. DFT calculations assist the interpretation of the vibrational spectroscopy and show that the remaining water is in the form of H3O+ solvated by the IL molecular ions. Hence, the species remaining after evaporation is a ternary PIL consisting of BMI+ cation, BF4? anion, and H3O+ cation. The H3O+ may be the principle charge carrier in the PIL solution and responsible for the high solution conductivity.},

  abstract = {The performance of several general gradient approximation, meta general gradient approximation, and hybrid functionals is tested against M?ller?Plesset perturbation theory second-order for ionic liquid systems. Additionally, two dispersion-corrected approaches (addition of van der Waals forces by a 1/r6 term and employing a dispersion-corrected atom-center dispersion pseudopotential) were studied. For the 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium cation neglecting dispersion results in different trends for structural stabilities. The two applied correction schemes for density functional theory improve the results tremendously. Investigating several 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium dicianamide ion pairs shows a mean absolute deviation from M?ller?Plesset perturbation theory of 35.7 kJ/mol for Hartree?Fock and up to 33.2 kJ/mol for the density functional theory methods. The dispersion-corrected methods reduce the mean absolute deviation to less than 10 kJ/mol. Comparing adducts of the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicianamide ion pair with Diels?Alder educts (cyclopentadiene and methylacrylate) shows similar energetic differences as for the ion pairs. Furthermore large deviations in geometries for the intermolecular distances were found for the Hartree?Fock approach (mean absolute deviation: 190 pm) and density functional theory (mean absolute deviation up to 178 pm) while for the dispersion-corrected methods the mean absolute deviation is less than 50 pm.},

  abstract = {A theoretical study of the structural and electronic properties of the chloride ion and water molecules in the first hydration shell is presented. The calculations are performed on an ensemble of configurations obtained from molecular dynamics simulations of a single chloride ion in bulk water. The simulations utilize the polarizable AMOEBA force field for trajectory generation and MP2-level calculations are performed to examine the electronic structure properties of the ions and surrounding waters in the external field of more distant waters. The ChelpG method is employed to explore the effective charges and dipoles on the chloride ions and first-shell waters. The quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM) is further utilized to examine charge transfer from the anion to surrounding water molecules. The clusters extracted from the AMOEBA simulations exhibit high probabilities of anisotropic solvation for chloride ions in bulk water. From the QTAIM analysis, 0.2 elementary charges are transferred from the ion to the first-shell water molecules. The default AMOEBA model overestimates the average dipole moment magnitude of the ion compared to the quantum mechanical value. The average magnitude of the dipole moment of the water molecules in the first shell treated at the MP2-level, with the more distant waters handled with an AMOEBA effective chargemodel, is 2.67 D. This value is close to the AMOEBA result for first-shell waters (2.72 D) and is slightly reduced from the bulk AMOEBA value (2.78 D). The magnitude of the dipole moment of the water molecules in the first solvation shell is most strongly affected by the local water-water interactions and hydrogen bonds with the second solvation shell, rather than by interactions with the ion.},
