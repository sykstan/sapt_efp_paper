Multilinear regression was performed by treating the EFP components as predictors and regressing against the total energy from both SAPT2+3 and CCSD(T)/CBS.
Furthermore, halides and non-halides were treated separately.
Since there are three basis sets for EFP, each component had twelve had twelve coefficients, for each basis set, for halide and non-haldie systems, and for different benchmarks.


\begin{equation}
    E^{\text{SAPT}}_{\text{Total Energy}} = \alpha E_{\text{Elec}}^{\text{EFP}} +
                                            \beta E_{\text{Exch-Repl}}^{\text{EFP}} +
                                            \gamma E_{\text{Ind-Pol}}^{\text{EFP}} +
                                            \delta E_{\text{Disp}}^{\text{EFP}}
\end{equation}

why is lm equation different from geom_smooth graph??
