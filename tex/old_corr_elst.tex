% correlation
In order to understand the trends between the energy components of the two methods, they were plotted against each other. 
These plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:sapt-efp-corr-all}.
Since aug-cc-pVTZ showed the best agreement with SAPT2+3,  its performance will be discussed further in the text. 
More detail for the other two basis sets can be found in the supplementary information.
The linear correlation is visually obvious for electrostatics, exchange, induction and dispersion components.
Since both methods decompose the interaction energy into the same physically meaningful components, this comes as no surprise.
As such, attempting a linear fit to between the two methods is one way of analysing the differences between the methods, giving insight into how and why EFP might deviate from SAPT2+3 results.

% give reason why elst, ind and disp should have linear correlation

Linear regression was performed assuming a linear relationship of the form $ y = a \cdot x $.
Scaled EFP energies are obtained by multiplying the original EFP energy with the scaling coefficient, the $a$ in from the equation above.
The coefficient $a$, as well as the associated regression statistics are given in Table \ref{tab:scaled-efp-atz-coef}.
Since all of the $R^2$ values fall between 0.9737 and 0.9999, they are not shown in the table.
Clear differences are seen between the halides and the typical ionic liquid anions.
Moreover, linear trends can be further split between the imidazolium and pyrrolidinium cations, further highlighting the importance of the cation-anion combination in determining the component-specific correlations.


Analysis of Table \ref{tab:scaled-efp-atz-coef} reveals that there is a drastic improvement for the scaled dispersion and induction components, with MAE falling below 3.2 \enUnit. 
Imidazolium halides are an exception, due to relatively large errors in the induction component (MAE = 11.4 \enUnit).
Except for these systems, maximum errors fall in a narrower range of -13.1 to 6.2 \enUnit.
Among the components studied, the gradient falls quite close to 1 for electrostatics and exchange-repulsion, within 3.5 \%, whereas for halides much larger differences, between 12 and 22\%, are observed in exchange for ILAs.
In general, for halides, EFP underestimates electrostatics and overestimates exchange-repulsion compared to SAPT2+3, and vice versa for the other typical IL anions.
As for the other components, EFP dose not show clear trends.
It tends to  underestimate induction up to 17\% for the ILAs, whereas for halides, the scaling coefficient ranges between 0.985 and 1.031.
In the case of halides, EFP underestimates dispersion between 8 and 15\%, whereas for the ILAs this component is overestimated between 13 and 23\%. 


For electrostatics and exchange, the maximum errors still fall in a wide range between -31.2 and 17.1 \enUnit.
The standard deviation is above 5 \enUnit~ on average, which is still unacceptable where chemical accuracy is required.


% message: errors *are* reducing, but not enough
Table \ref{tab:scaled-perc-stats-atz} shows the relative errors of the scaled EFP energetic components and the total interaction energy with respect to SAPT.
One can clearly see that the errors for the induction and dispersion components reduce to below 20\%.
% dispersion expected to be linear
For the dispersion term, this can be expected, as the dispersion component in EFP was formulated against SAPT dispersion.
\cite{Adamovic2005a}
It is important to note that \catb{mpyr}{n} halide systems performed exceptionally well, with a maximum error of 10.4\% for induction, and only 5.1\% for dispersion.
The exchange component still gives errors between 5.3\% for \catb{mpyr}{n} halides and 31.6\% for the pyrrolidinium ion pairs coupled with the ILAs.
Although the relative error for electrostatics drops below 10\% for all systems under study (with all three basis sets), due to the magnitude of this component, maximum errors can still exceed -30 \enUnit~(\emph{e.g.} in the case of \ipair{mim}{4}{br})
The same applies to the exchange component that gives relative errors below 3.3\% on average, whereas the maximum errors can still be up to -27.7 \enUnit~ as observed for \ipair{mim}{2}{dca}.


In Figure \ref{fig:hist-raw-scaled-atz} the distribution of EFP errors for each energetic component is shown.
The solid histograms are the raw differences, whereas the line density plots are the errors obtained after scaling.
The plots are separated in a grid based on the component of the interaction energy, as well as the type of anion, halides and ILAs.
As expected, the scaling shifts the mean of the distribution for each component towards zero.
In particular, the scaling achieves narrower distributions for some components, such as dispersion and induction.
It appears that linear regression did not improve the spread of errors for electrostatics and exchange-repulsion, indicating that there are shortcomings in the EFP formulation of these components when applied to ionic liquids.


It is hypothesized that the errors from electrostatics and exchange-repulsion come from the fact that higher order contributions are not included in the EFP formulation.
In order to test this hypothesis, first order electrostatic and first order exchange components calculated with SAPT2+3 were compared with their corresponding EFP components. 
% halides smaller, sits closer, simple 1 atom so exchange easy to calculate
% ILAs further, smaller exchange, but more interaction sites--larger errors
In Table \ref{tab:trunc-stats-atz} the statistics on these differences are given.
Only a small difference was observed for electrostatics, thus indicating that perhaps higher order terms do not contribute a significant amount to the electrostatic interaction.
As for the exchange component, the difference between first order SAPT and full EFP is reduced to below 4.2 \enUnit~ on average, for all ion pairs with ILAs.
On the contrary, the errors for EFP exchange almost triple for halides, when compared with first order SAPT exchange-repulsion.
For example, for the imidazolium based halides the MAE increases from 8.6 to 27.5 \enUnit.


These findings clearly indicate the importance of higher order terms in exchange-repulsion for typical ILAs but not halides.
Compared to the correlations between SAPT2+3 and EFP in Table \ref{tab:scaled-efp-atz-coef} for the halides, exchange is slightly overestimated by EFP, by about 3\%, whereas in the ILAs, EFP underestimates exchange between 12 and 22\% on average. 
While halides have a higher exchange energy in general, roughly 60 \enUnit~ more than that of the other ILAs, they also give smaller errors. 
Due to the smaller size of halide anions, the optimal geometry of the ion pair has shorter distances between the cation and anion, thus resulting in higher exchange-repulsion energies.
It is suggested that having a single atom as the anion reduces the complexity of the interaction, and is thus better modelled by EFP.
On the other hand, the ILAs are more complex as they have multiple interaction sites.
In this case, the optimal geometry of the ion pair positions the anion further away from the cation, leading to lower exchange-repulsion energies.
At the same time, due to the presence of multiple interaction sites, the overall error increases with the number of possible interaction sites.


Tables \ref{tab:s22-s66-trunc} and \ref{tab:s22-s66-perc} show the actual contributions of higher order terms to the electrostatic and exchange components in SAPT2+3.
The tables contrast contributions for the ionic liquid systems studied to the neutral intermolecular complexes taken from the S22 and S66 databases.

Surprisingly, for the higher order contributions of the electrostatic component in ionic liquids, only slight differencse were observed between ionic liquids and neutral complexes.
The maximum contribution did not exceed 6.5 \enUnit~ for all the systems, be it ionic or neutral.
On the relative scale, these contributions constitute a much smaller portion of the electrostatic component, usually below 1\%. 
On the other hand, the neutral complexes from S22 and S66 show a much higher relative contribution, up to 19\% in some cases, for example in the ethyne dimer.
For exchange-repulsion, the higher order contributions are larger for ionic liquids on the absolute scale when compared to the neutral complexes.
Nevertheless, the maximum contributions could be not be split between ionic and neutral systems, up to almost 30 \enUnit.
Hydrogen-bonded complexes from the S22 and S66 databases tend to have a larger exchange component due to orbital overlap.
Furthermore, on the relative scale, the higher order contributions fall in a narrow range of 11\% for neutral complexes and 14\% for ionic liquids.
As established above, for ionic liquids EFP matches SAPT exchange-repulsion energies up to the first order only, as seen in Table \ref{tab:s22-s66-perc}.
Higher order exchange terms are equally important in ionic and neutral complexes, thus suggesting that EFP shortcomings in exchange are not restricted to ionic systems.
The magnitude of the error for exchange in EFP is dependent on the complexity of the interaction and proximity of interacting species. 
Furthermore, the absolute error also increases as the magnitude of the energy increases.
